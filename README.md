# Renewable Energy Trading Grid

## Project Description

The Renewable Energy Trading Grid is a decentralized blockchain-based platform that enables homeowners and businesses with renewable energy sources (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) to directly trade excess energy with their neighbors and community members. The platform eliminates traditional energy intermediaries and creates a peer-to-peer energy marketplace with transparent pricing and automated transactions.

Using smart contracts, energy producers can list their available energy for sale, while consumers can purchase energy directly from these distributed sources. The system integrates with IoT smart meters through oracles to verify actual energy production and consumption, ensuring accurate and trustless transactions.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize the energy market by creating a decentralized grid where:
- Every household can become an energy producer and trader
- Renewable energy adoption is incentivized through direct economic benefits
- Communities become energy self-sufficient and resilient
- Energy trading is transparent, efficient, and accessible to all
- Carbon footprint reduction is achieved through localized energy distribution
